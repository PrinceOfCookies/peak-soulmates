# Soulmates

A multiplayer mod that matches players into pairs, where each player in a pair shares damage of the other. Based on the "shared damage" mod.

## WARNING WARNING WARNING

THIS MOD IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT. It doesn't crash at start, but I don't know yet what it does. Have fun.

## Features

Implemented:

* To be tested.

Implemented, but maybe buggy:

* Sharing damage!
* Sharing hunger and weight!
* Sharing healing!
* New soulmates chosen at every biome!
* Sharing bonks! (configurable)
* Sharing extra stamina gain! (configurable)
* Sharing extra stamina USE! (configurable)

## Planned features

* Logo that's not a half-assed "shared damage" ripoff.
* Better way to indicate who's your soulmate.
* Fix bugs.
* Configuration options: what damage is shared, damage multipliers, etc.

## Installation

1. Extract the mod folder into `BepInEx/plugins`

## Configuration

1. Run the mod once.
2. Open and edit the file `BepInEx/config/com.github.Wesmania.Soulmates.cfg` in PEAK's directory.

## Multiplayer Compatibility

This mod uses custom network events. Because of this it's best that all players in the lobby have the mod installed. If some players don't have the mod, weird and bad things will probably happen.
