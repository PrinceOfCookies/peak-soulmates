# Soulmates

A multiplayer mod that matches players into pairs, where each player in a pair shares damage of the other. Based on the "shared damage" mod.

## WARNING WARNING WARNING

THIS MOD IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT. It doesn't crash at start, but I don't know yet what it does. Have fun.

## Features

* Sharing damage! (if it's not buggy)
* Sharing hunder and weight! (if it's not buggy)
* Sharing healing! (if it's not buggy)
* New soulmates chosen at every biome! (if it's not buggy)

## Planned features

* Logo that's not a half-assed "shared damage" ripoff.
* Better way to indicate who's your soulmate.
* Fix bugs.
* Configuration options: what damage is shared, damage multipliers, etc.

## Installation

1. Extract the mod folder into `BepInEx/plugins`

## Multiplayer Compatibility

This mod uses custom network events. Because of this it's best that all players in the lobby have the mod installed. If some players don't have the mod, weird and bad things will probably happen.
