# Soulmates

A multiplayer mod that matches players into pairs, where each player in a pair shares damage of the other. Based on the "shared damage" mod.

## WARNING WARNING WARNING

THIS MOD IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT. For now it probably just crashes or something, it's been like an hour of untested editing of another mod.

## Features

## Planned features

* Logo that's not a half-assed "shared damage" ripoff.
* Better way to indicate who's your soulmate.
* Making healing affect both players as well.
* Sharing hunger and weight.
* Configuration options: what damage is shared, damage multipliers, etc.

## Installation

## Multiplayer Compatibility

This mod uses custom network events. Because of this it's best that all players in the lobby have the mod installed. Players without the mod will not send or receive shared damage.
