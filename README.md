# Soulmates

A multiplayer mod that matches players into pairs, where each player in a pair shares damage of the other. Based on the "shared damage" mod.

## WARNING WARNING WARNING

THIS MOD IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT. I played a few games with it and it seems to more-or-less work, but don't be surprised by bugs.

## Features

Implemented:

* To be tested.

Implemented, but maybe buggy:

* Sharing damage!
* Sharing hunger and weight!
* Sharing healing!
* New soulmates chosen at every biome!
* Sharing bonks! (configurable)
* Sharing extra stamina gain! (configurable)
* Sharing extra stamina USE! (configurable)
* Shared lollipops and energy drinks! (configurable)

## Planned features

* Logo that's not a half-assed "shared damage" ripoff.
* Better way to indicate who's your soulmate.
* Fix bugs.

## Installation

1. Extract the mod folder into `BepInEx/plugins`

## Configuration

1. Run the mod once.
2. Open and edit the file `BepInEx/config/com.github.Wesmania.Soulmates.cfg` in PEAK's directory.

## Multiplayer Compatibility

This mod uses custom network events. Because of this it's best that all players in the lobby have the mod installed. If some players don't have the mod, weird and bad things will probably happen.
